#PyTest is the unit testing framework for python
#Using pytest we can control the test case execution as per our needs
#ease to setup pre requiste meaning what all you need to execute actual test cases like opening the browser and entering
#the url, connecting to DB such events and post scripts means what is need to be done after executing the test cases like closing
#the browser, terminating the DB connections
#used to add assertions
#used to generate reports

#NAMING CONVENTIONS IN PYTEST
#1. test case file should start with test
#the test case methods will even execute even if the module/file name isn't starting with test but module/file
#methods should manditory be start with test.
#2. Test case method name should start with test
#3. change file name or test name - module/file name can need not be start with test but it is good practise
#to module/file name and its methods to start with 'test'
#4. execute test cases using pytest

#WRITTING TEST CASES IN PYTEST
#You can write multiple test cases in a single file
#you can skip execution any specific test case - using pytest decorator
#Conditionaly skip the execution
#execute speciific test case
#display detailed result
