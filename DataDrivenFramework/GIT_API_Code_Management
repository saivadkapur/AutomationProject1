API Testing - Code Management-Create Batch File

1. create batch file with all required libraries
Batch files are used to hold the required libraries like Requests, json, jsonpath, openpyxl etc so that when you are trying to
execute your test cases using Jenkin this batch file is used to install all these libraries in the batch file

Create a directory in your project give any name like "BatchFiles" now open a file in your system and start adding all the
libraries you think that are used for executing your test cases like add "pip install pytest", "pip install json" in the notepad file
and save the file into the "BatchFiles" folder with .bat extension "AllLibrary.bat"

2. place that file in project itself
