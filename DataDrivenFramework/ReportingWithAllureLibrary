Allure Reporting

Allure is an open source framework used to create test execution reports
Any report is generated in two steps

Step-1:
During the test execution a small library called adapter attached to testing framework saves information
about executed tests to json format

Step-2:
during the report generation json format files are transformed to HTML report. This can be done with a command line
tool, a plugin for CI or build tool

ALLURE INSTALLATION PROCESS
Step 1: pip install allure-pytest
Step 2: Setup command line tool for converting json files to HTML report
        install java 8+
        install node.js
        install command line tool
        npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev
